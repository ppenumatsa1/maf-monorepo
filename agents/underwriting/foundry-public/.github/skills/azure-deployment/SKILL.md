# Azure Deployment Skill

Use this skill only after Azure validation passes.

## Hard gates

- Require authenticated Azure and `azd` context via `make foundry-bootstrap`.
- Run `make foundry-postgres-readiness` before deploying hosted runtime changes.
- Do not run the destructive PostgreSQL rebuild path unless the user explicitly requested that exact action with the required confirmation token.

## Deployment sequence

Use only the existing repository commands that match the changed surface:

```bash
make foundry-provision
make foundry-postgres-schema
make foundry-postgres-credentials
make foundry-postgres-readiness
make foundry-deploy
make foundry-release-deploy
make foundry-backend-deploy
make foundry-frontend-deploy
```

Guidance:

- Infra/auth/firewall changes -> include `make foundry-provision` and the PostgreSQL credential/schema steps.
- Hosted agent/runtime changes -> `make foundry-deploy`.
- Public adapter changes -> `make foundry-backend-deploy`.
- Public frontend changes -> `make foundry-frontend-deploy`.
- Use `make foundry-release-deploy` for a complete release deployment. It runs
  PostgreSQL readiness once, then safely builds/deploys the public backend,
  frontend, and hosted agent concurrently.
- Do not serialize independent component deployments. The frontend resolves the
  existing stable backend FQDN and does not require the backend image rollout
  to finish first.
- Provision only for actual IaC changes. Application, Docker, script, and
  telemetry changes reuse existing infrastructure after the validated preview.

## Post-deploy verification

Run the required gates in dependency order:

```bash
make foundry-smoke
make -j2 foundry-hosted-e2e foundry-eval
make foundry-telemetry
```

If the deployed frontend is in scope, also run:

```bash
cd frontend && PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL="$WEB_URL" npm run test:e2e
```

## Destructive exception

The only destructive server-reset path is:

```bash
make foundry-postgres-rebuild CONFIRM=REBUILD-azpgwhcedyxchnbtmpub
```

Do not use it unless the user explicitly asked for a full server rebuild.

## Output

Report the environment used, per-stage timing, smoke/E2E/eval/telemetry results,
and any blockers or recovery actions.

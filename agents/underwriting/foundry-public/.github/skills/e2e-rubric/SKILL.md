# E2E Rubric Skill

Use this skill when editing UI behavior, API responses, workflow events, AG-UI, CopilotKit, or hosted release criteria.

## Rubric sources

- `frontend/tests/e2e/rubric.ts`
- `frontend/tests/e2e/underwriting.spec.ts`
- `docs/design/e2e-rubric.md`

## Automated criteria

The Playwright rubric must continue to validate:

1. happy path decision
2. retry behavior
3. crash status and resumable run id
4. resume completion
5. fan-in shared state
6. checkpoint visibility
7. idempotency skip visibility
8. observability fields in event output

## Release-only criterion

9. public hosted smoke confirms the public request correlates with hosted workflow/model traces and safe Foundry evaluation evidence.

## Guardrails

- Do not weaken rubric coverage without an explicit task.
- Keep rubric terminology aligned across Playwright, design docs, and instruction files.
- If a criterion changes intentionally, update the test, the rubric source, and the relevant docs together.

## Required verification

```bash
make test-e2e
```

For hosted/public-lane changes, also run:

```bash
make foundry-smoke
make foundry-eval
```

# E2E Rubric (Order Resolution)

Use this skill when editing UI behavior, API responses, workflow events, HITL,
AG-UI, CopilotKit, or selected-thread contracts.

## Rubric sources

- `frontend/tests/e2e/*`
- `backend/tests/test_order_resolution_boundaries.py`
- `backend/tests/test_workflow.py`
- `backend/tests/test_api.py`

## Automated criteria

Keep coverage for:

1. a low-risk `ORD-1001` workflow completing without HITL unless an explicit
   damaged-item or manual-review condition applies;
2. a high-risk `ORD-1009` workflow creating a durable HITL request and
   completing after its checkpoint-keyed approval or rejection;
3. the stable native SSE event types, ordering, and durable-history replay;
4. wrapper behavior in which initial dispatch is non-streaming and the browser
   receives state through durable reads and persisted-event SSE;
5. optional AG-UI selected-thread failures that leave the native timeline and
   operator controls available;
6. CopilotKit's selected-thread allowlist and redaction boundary, including no
   browser access to Foundry, PostgreSQL, MCP/RAG data, credentials, or secrets;
7. correlation identifiers and safe terminal/error state visibility without
   exposing raw payloads.
8. static, redacted `GET /api/copilotkit/info` discovery and a `POST
   /api/copilotkit` bridge that accepts only an existing selected `threadId` as
   meaningful input; supplied messages, state, tools, context, and forwarded
   props must not affect the workflow.

## Guardrails

- Do not weaken native SSE, durable HITL, or privacy coverage merely because an
  additive AG-UI or CopilotKit surface is unavailable.
- CopilotKit is the selected assistant UI integration, not the GitHub Copilot
  SDK. Test its read-only selected-thread behavior independently of the
  workflow path.
- Do not treat source configuration or local tests as evidence of a deployed
  public endpoint. Use an existing hosted gate only when the task explicitly
  requires hosted validation.
- If a criterion changes intentionally, update its tests and the relevant
  source-contract documentation in the same change.

## Required verification

```bash
# Runs the existing workflow suite plus the frontend selected-thread integration.
make test-e2e

# Focused selected-thread integration test; Vite starts on 127.0.0.1:4175
# when PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL is not supplied.
make test-e2e-selected-thread

# Retained, separate Docker workflow-E2E profile.
make docker-test
```

Credential-free CI runs `make test-e2e-selected-thread` directly and retains
`make docker-test`; it does not treat the Docker workflow suite as a substitute
for the frontend selected-thread integration.

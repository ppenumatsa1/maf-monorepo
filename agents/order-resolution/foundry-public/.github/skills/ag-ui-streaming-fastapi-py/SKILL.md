# AG-UI Streaming for FastAPI (Order Resolution)

Use this skill when changing streaming APIs, event envelopes, the selected-thread
assistant bridge, or backend-to-frontend event projection.

## Scope

- Stable and additive route entrypoints: `backend/app/api/v1/routers/*`
- Stream and bridge schemas: `backend/app/api/v1/schemas/*`
- Safe projection and durable-tail helpers:
  `backend/app/modules/order_resolution/agui.py` and
  `backend/app/modules/order_resolution/durable_events.py`
- Boundary coverage: `backend/tests/test_order_resolution_boundaries.py`

## Invariants

- Native workflow events and durable PostgreSQL projections remain the source of
  truth. Rich AG-UI and CopilotKit frames are additive views, never a
  replacement for the stable native SSE contract.
- Preserve the stable event types and their consumer behavior:
  `workflow.stage`, `tool.call`, `checkpoint.created`, `hitl.request`,
  `hitl.response`, and `workflow.output`.
- Retain the single sequential MAF path based on `FoundryChatClient` and
  `SequentialBuilder`. The HTTP wrapper projects or relays durable state; it
  must not create a second orchestration path.
- Preserve durable checkpoint-keyed HITL pause/resume and event ordering. The
  external frontend receives a non-streaming initial wrapper dispatch, then
  polls durable state and subscribes to persisted-event SSE.
- CopilotKit is the selected read-only assistant integration. It is not the
  GitHub Copilot SDK. `GET /api/copilotkit/info` (and `GET /api/copilotkit`)
  returns static discovery only. `POST /api/copilotkit` may select one existing
  `threadId` and expose only the allowlisted, redacted projection; it must not
  start work or honor supplied `runId`, messages, state, tools, context,
  forwarded props, credentials, or arbitrary thread data.
- Never project raw order or policy data, MCP/RAG results, tool
  arguments/results, prompts, model output, checkpoint payloads, credentials,
  or secrets. Keep external-browser -> internal-wrapper access and privacy
  boundaries intact.
- The selected-thread projection may emit only `RUN_STARTED`, safe
  `STEP_*`/`TOOL_CALL_*` frames, CUSTOM checkpoint/approval summaries with
  validated UUIDs and approved/rejected decisions, generic terminal/error
  text, and `RUN_FINISHED`. Do not use the existing `/rich` native-event
  envelope as a redacted assistant stream.

## Required verification

1. Run the affected backend projection and boundary tests, including
   `backend/tests/test_order_resolution_boundaries.py`.
2. Verify the static `GET /api/copilotkit/info` discovery response and that
   standard CopilotKit input is discarded rather than acted upon.
3. Run `make test-e2e` when a browser-visible stream or bridge contract changes.
4. Confirm an optional AG-UI/CopilotKit failure does not break native SSE or
   durable-history behavior.
